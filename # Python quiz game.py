# Python quiz game

#For your next assignment, you will be building a quiz game that: [f] = finished.
#   uses text based input (not a Tkinter GUI) [f]
#   asks the user 15 multiple choice questions [f]
#   uses Tuples  to store your question data (questions and answers) [f]
#   checks their answers [f]
#   keeps score [f]
#   Give out a percentage score [f]
#   Comment your code [f]
#   Show testing evidence [f]
#   asks users if they want to play again (at the end) [f]
#   Commit to Github at every stage to show version control [f]
#   Exit the program [f]
