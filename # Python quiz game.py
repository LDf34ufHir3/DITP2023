# Python quiz game
# Declare all the Collections and variable we need:
#   Questions,Answers, Quit, 
# We need a Tuple of questions, a 2D tuple of options
# You need to have 15 questions
# It will also have a tuple of answers
# There will be a list of guesses so we can append our list.

# There will be these variables:
# score set 0
